# Reminder Chrome Extension


## Purpose:
A solo project meant to provide a better understanding of the Chrome Javascript api and its interaction with Chrome extensions and the chrome browser.

## Functionality:
Currently, the extension allows the user to create reminders that get stored locally with the chrome browser. The extension allows the user to delete any created reminder. User's can also set a time for the reminder. After that time has past, the reminder will be sent to a different list of all other expired reminders. It will remain there until dismissed by the user.
